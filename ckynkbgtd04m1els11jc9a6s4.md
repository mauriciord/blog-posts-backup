# Refactoring culture

When you're doing a big refactoring into your project, there's sometimes that is better to create new things than modify the existing things. It's a good plan, because you make sure that you don't break anything.

It was a great tip from @sibelius

Even with a complete copy of a file, just changing its name and a single line, it's easier to make incremental changes to the files that'll use your new refactored component
